component-lab
=====================

My opinionated and very minimal environment for developing
and testing UI components. Mostly, but not exclusively, used with React.

Development environment for the component is found in `./example`
and the component under development in `./src`.

Changes to files in both directories will trigger hot reloading.

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`

hack away!
